in the organnizer function i try to sort my token into 4 kinds:
it either a command: that will be executed, primarly there is 1 command per family. Group name: COMMAND : 102
it either a parameter: can be many parameters will be passed to the command, in execve after finishing parsing . Group name: PARAM: 103
it either an operator: (>>, >, <) heredoc is a little complicated, but anytime i find one of the operator i set its group as OP. Group name: OP 104
it either a filename: it can be a filename when the preceding token is an operator (>> < >). Group name: FILENAME: 101

it works like this:
cycles through each family
		sets a flag to 0 for each family
				cycles through each token inside the family
						if the flag is still set to 0 it checkes if the token is of type STR, VAR, DQUOTE, SQUOTE
								if true it sets the token group to COMMAND and sets the flag to 1 or just increments it
										everything else is set to PARAM
								after setting everytign to either a PARAM or COMMAND we now check if the current token of type operator 
									if so we set the token's group to OP
										after that so we check the one after it (we skip spaces) if it is of type STR or VAR or DQUOTE or SQUOTE
												if so we set that token to type FILENAME
we keep cycling for each family and each token
