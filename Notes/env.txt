==> The env linked list would be a dynamic list that holds all the env variables
It adds and removes set_variables(tokens)

==> If the var passed to the function doesnt start with something other than
an underscore or a character the deletion needs to be discarded

In case that I want to remove a token
		=>  I'll itterate through the list of env variables one by one
		=> Through each itteration i'll split the env value taking the first
		part aside then comparing it to the variable value that i intend to remove
		=> In each case ill compare both the unset and variable inside the node
			-> if these's a match then we'll need to delete that node

In case I want to add it ill call append variable funcitno that
it enforces that the start of the varaible is either an undersoce of an
alphabetic charcater
then itll simply append the variable to the list of env variables

The Initial creation of the linked list shouldnt be followed by freeing the 2d array of envp
rather it should be done when we have already used it and it needs to be updated just to
prevent any ressources leaks later on
