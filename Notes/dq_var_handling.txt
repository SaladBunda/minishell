worked on checkign if a node is a double string node, if so i get inside the dq_var.
in the dq_var i go character by character untili find a dollar sign when i do i check if there is a valid variable name after.
if so i get inside the search_replace which search for the var name inside the env linked list, if i find it return the result of the variable and pass it to var_value;
after that i pass the var_value and all the indexes used by adress also the token
inside hte substitution i get calculate the new size of the token->value and malloc it after that i copy from the old token->value to the string mallocated and then copy the var value and after i copy the rest of the token->value after calculate the rest
and then i update the index so that in the dq_var it continues from where the substitution of the variable ended
ex:
command: "bunda $bunda $nabil"
first it will copy "bunda"
after that it will replace bunda with 3 (inside path)
after that it i will copy the rest of command beginning from after the furst variable name in this example after the 'a'
currently the node value is :"bunda 3 $nabil"
the index will be update after the 3 which is the space
the loop will restart 



"ahwdahjbw $bunda $anwkdnajkw"
ahwdahjbw
ahwdahjbw 3
ahwdahjbw 3 $anwkdnajkw

ahwdahjbw 3 \0
